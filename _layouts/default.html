  <h3>About the Course</h3>
  <p>Computer Science 2212 - Introduction to Software Engineering is a course designed to examine the stages of the software engineering process, including requirements gathering, specification, design, implementation, and testing. Students of CS 2212 are required to work cooperatively in a team to design and implement a moderately large software system.</p>
  <h3>Our Project</h3>
  <p><i>Developed by Team 13</i>
  <p>There is a disconnect between students and the events going on around them. Councils, clubs, and societies across campus have no standardized method to communicate with students. Students are left to figure out whats going on across campus on their own. From this insight came the inception of LIT, a service that aims to fill the gap and bring the events of all clubs and societies across campus directly to students, using a novel and intuitive user interface.</p>
    <p>LIT is a heat map event tracker that displays current and future events. Each event will be defined by an area on the map with geo-fencing using Google Maps API. A user who enters the defined area will add to the event counter - which displays how many users are within that event’s area. The density of people will be visually displayed through color. For example: events of low, medium, and high user density will be filled in with yellow, orange, and red colours respectively. By clicking or tapping on the event area, a user can see more information about that specific event. A time slider will allow the user to view events on the map at later points in time.</p>

<div id="UI DESIGN" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
  <p>UI design seems to have reached a state of homogeneity; with flat, brightly coloured, minimal interfaces accounting for many modern applications. Though our team sees the benefits of having simple design elements in a user interface, we aim to stand out with a <i>dark</i> colour scheme while still retaining the well established minimal aesthetic. This choice is not only easier on the eyes, but also provides increased contrast when looking at events with our <i>heat map</i> interface.
  </p><br>
  <h3>Login</h3>
<p>The user is introduced to a simple Login page, which  allows a user to sign up, sign up with Facebook, or log into the application.</p>
  <img src="./website/img/login.jpg" /><br>
  <p>The Sign Up page requests that a user fills in the necessary info to generate an account if they decide to make a local account. Using Facebook's authentication API, a user can alternatively have their info filled in automatically with their Facebook profile.</p>
  <img src="./website/img/login2.jpg" /><br>
  <h3>Discover</h3>
  <p>The Discover tab allows a user to find and interact with events. The page defaults to a map of Western's campus, where all current events can be seen at a glance. By clicking on any event on the map, the user is presented with information about the event including the location, time, number of attendees, and which friends of theirs are attending the event. They are also given the option to RSVP the event, which will add the event to the user's <i>Attending Events</i>. A filter at the bottom allows the user to specify the events he would like to see on the map, and a search bar allows for further filtering. A <i>Time Slider</i> at the top allows a user to browse upcoming events on the map by cycling through future dates.</p>
  <img src="./website/img/discover.jpg" /><br>
  <h3>Create</h3>
  <p>The Create tab allows a user to create and edit an event. First the user is prompted to identify the vertices of the event on the map to generate a designated perimeter for the event. The user must then add a title, photo, description, event type, time, and floor number to their event. If the event is repeating they can choose to add additional days to the event. The user can also delete the event if they choose to change their mind.</p>
  <img src="./website/img/create.jpg" /><br>
  <h3>Additional Options</h3>
  <p>The Active Events option lets a user browse current events in a timeline format and sort them by proximity, popularity, and date.</p>
  <img src="./website/img/timeline.jpg" /><br>
  <p>The Attending Events option lets a user view and modify the events they have chosen to attend.</p>
  <img src="./website/img/events.jpg" /><br>
  <p>The Settings option allows a user to modify their account, manage their events, and provides access to help resources.</p>

     <h2>Features</h2>
    <h3>Authentication System</h3>
    <p>Users will have the option to create an account through traditional email and password or using Facebook Login API.<br>
    <b>Feasibility:</b> Simple, this has been implemented<br>
    <b>Dependency:</b> Relies on Facebook API for registration, local database to store account info.
    </p>
    <h3>Event Creation</h3>
  <p>Users can create an edit their own events, which will be stored in a local database. Basic event information like the name, description and floor level will be inputted by the user. An integrated calendar UI will allow the user to select a date and time, and the option to add photos will be included.
    <br>To define the event’s area, the user will input the vertices of the event on the map, and a perimeter will be generated from these vertices.
    <br><b>Feasibility:</b> Relatively complex. Calendar UI will need to span multiple years to be fully functional. Creating the event perimeter will require integration with Google Maps API. The event perimeter and creation have been implemented, the calander UI has not<br>
    <b>Dependency:</b> Requires a functioning event database and successful use of Google Maps API.
  </p>
    <h3>Map-Based Event Browsing</h3>
  <p>The user is shown a map of Western's campus, where all current events can be seen at a glance. By clicking on any event on the map, the user is presented with information about the event including the location, time, number of attendees, and which friends of theirs are attending the event. They are also given the option to RSVP the event, which will add the event to the user's Attending Events. A filter allows the user to specify the events they would like to see on the map, and a search bar allows for further filtering. A Time Slider at the top allows a user to browse upcoming events on the map by cycling through future dates.
    <br>
    <b>Feasibility:</b> Medium complexity. Requires an intuitive UI to navigate events. Most data is being pulled from the event database, so no need for complex algorithms.<br>
    <b>Dependency: Dependent on a functioning event database to pull information from each event. This has not been implemented on the map, but individual events can be viewed on the map by themselves from the All Events page</b>
    </p>
    <h3>Heat Map</h3>
  <p>A map interface will display all active and future events over a map of Western’s Campus. Each event’s area will be coloured in depending on the density of users in the area using simulated data points.
    <br>
    <b>Feasibility:</b> Medium complexity. Vertices of the event will need to be converted to longitude / latitude points on the map to allow for overlaying. Event colour will be provided using predefined colour values for a given number of people and pulled from the event database. This has been implemented and events can be viewed all at once.
    <br>
    <b>Dependency:</b> Requires successful use of Google Maps API to place event areas on the map.
  </p>
  <h3>Active Events</h3>
  <p>A user will be able to browse current events in a timeline format and sort them by date, category and recently created.
    <br><b>Feasibility:</b> Relatively complex. Using simulated data, we will events in the datebase and and on the map. Date can be sorted by already provided data. The events can be sorted and searched on the all events page.
    <b>Dependency:</b> Requires successful use database and storage of events and users.
  </p>
    <h2>Additional Features</h2>
    <h3>Attending Events</h3>
  <p>A user can view the events they have chosen to attend, and has the option to delete them from the list. This has not been implemented</p> 
    <h3>User Settings</h3>
  <p>A user can modify their account (delete, change name and photo), manage their events (delete, change information), and has access to help resources (written guide to application). This has been implemented
  </p>

<div id="PROJECT RETROSPECTIVE" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>MVC / Design Patterns</h2>
  <h3>What is the relationship between user interfaces, application logic, and data in your project?</h3>
  <p> The users input their data, such as when creating an event or changing profile information, into the user interface which is processed through HTML and passed to JavaScript controllers. These controllers then perform any application logic and the querying of the database.  The data for our project is stored in Firebase, an online database provided by Google, which contains the users and events data. </p>
  <h3>Did you implement your server-side program as a REST API?</h3>
  <p>Our server-side program was not implemented as a REST API since Firebase and JavaScript made it very easy to access data directly from the database and pass it to our program.</p>
  <h3>Which collection of classes serve as the M, V, and C in MVC?</h3>
  <p>The Firebase database serves as the model (M) in our project as it stores all of our data to be manipulated. The project’s views (V) are all implemented in the HTML files, such as allevents.html or addevent.html, which pass data to the controllers and display the results to the user. The controllers (C) of the project are the JavaScript files, such as allevents.js or events.js. These files take the input from the HTML files and perform the data querying and manipulation.</p>
  <h3>How do these classes communicate with each other? Give an example based on a user action.</h3>
  <p>When the user navigates to the All Events page, they can select a category from a drop down menu or search for an event. When they select a category and click the submit button this immediately passes the category name as a string through a function call in the allevents.html file to the allevents.js controller. This JavaScript function then performs a few comparisons to check what category the user wants to view. When it has decided on which output the user wants, it populates a list by querying Firebase based on the category each event has as an attribute. The function then returns the list to HTML file and displays it to the user.</p>
  <h3>If you were to start the project again today, what aspects of code organization could be improved in your project?</h3>
  <p>If we were to start over, we could improve on our JavaScript controllers. The project would benefit from a more overarching class structure for subclasses to inherit so we could reuse more code. This way we would not have to worry about changing a variable that may break other components. We could also use this idea to have fewer JavaScript files to help keep the project organized. We could also improve on keeping our code as close as possible to what was laid out in the UML diagram. This way when knew components are added everyone would still understand what information is being manipulated and where it is supposed to be sent. </p>
