## Introduction

There is a disconnect between students and the events going on around them. Councils, clubs, and societies across campus have no standardized method to communicate with students. Students are left to figure out whats going on across campus on their own. From this insight came the inception of LIT, a service that aims to fill the gap and bring the events of all clubs and societies across campus directly to students, using a novel and intuitive user interface.


## Guest Browsing

You can browse current events on the site without registering in two ways. The marker button on the bottom right brings you to a map of all the events on campus, and the list button on the bottom right brings you to a list of all events on campus.
