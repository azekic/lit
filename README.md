#User Guide
To access our project, simply click **[here](http://liteventtracker.com/app/#/login)** and you will be directed to our website. The master branch contains the most up to date version of our project and sub branches contain various pieces of the project.
Unfortunately, we experienced issues with merging our separate branches, and as a result, many of our existing features are displaced within various sub-branches. We have uploaded these subbranches to our FTP for easy access of the features. The following guide will help you navigate these features.

##Registration

##Login
