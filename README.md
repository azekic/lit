LIT is a heat map event tracker that displays current and future events. Each event will be defined by an area on the map with geo-fencing using Google Maps API. A user who enters the defined area will add to the event counter - which displays how many users are within that event’s area. The density of people will be visually displayed through color. For example: events of low, medium, and high user density will be filled in with yellow, orange, and red colours respectively. By clicking or tapping on the event area, a user can see more information about that specific event. A time slider will allow the user to view events on the map at later points in time.

### ANDRE ZEKIC
![alt text](./website/img/andre.jpg)

Andre is a fourth year student at Western University pursuing a double major in Chemistry and Computer Science. He is often seen speeding across campus on his electric longboard or drinking concerning amounts of Soylent. His position as *Computer Science Representative* and *VP of Promotions* on Western’s *Science Student’s Council* and the *Chemistry Club* respectively brought insight towards a concerning truth – councils, clubs, and societies across campus have no standardized method to communicate with students. Students are left to figure out whats going on across campus on their own. From this insight came the inception of ‘Lit’, a service that aims to fill the gap and bring the events of all clubs and societies across campus directly to students.
