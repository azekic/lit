## About Us

This is the project page for **TEAM 13**. This project is being done for the class Computer Science 2212B at Western University. The team will use the **Agile** software development method to develop a web application with simulated data.

Nandi is a second year computer science student at Western University. He is from Milton, Ontario but was originally born in India. He plans on attending the Richard Ivey School of Business next year to double major in Computer Science and Business Administration. Nandi has been coding since he was 11 and can code in C, C#, C++, Java, and Python. He also works at RezNet, the Internet Service Provider at Western University. Fun fact: Nandi crashed his car into a 80 year old lady.

## <a name="2.1"></a>About the application

**lit** is described as a “heat map” event tracker that displays current and future local events on a virtual map. This project intends to provide a new method of event tracking using a map-focused user interface and a live counter to make users more aware of popular local events around them. This project will use a web-based application with simulated data. The actual application of this data would require users to sign in to the location by visiting the website or after future development (outside the scope of this class), using their personal cellular devices.

## <a name="3.1"></a>UI

Write a brief description of the look and feel you want your program to have, or cite an existing design language (e.g. minimal, Material Design, flat design, etc.) You could also cite an existing application or website as a source of inspiration. Describe at a very high level how users will interact with your software.

This page should also include mock-ups of screens or views you plan to include in your application. You should use, at the very least, a vector graphics based drawing tool to create examples. You could also use photos of a whiteboard drawing as long as they are exceptionally clear and easy to understand. Better yet, why not search for a free mock-up tool online to generate these for you? You might find something useful.

No matter the format, ensure that your UI Design Page portrays the intended interfaces for all of your application’s user facing features, and how users will navigate between them.
